|Extractor Tool, Maded By Kameleon20       |
|It's NOT allowed to change the name,      |
|To make it look as you maded it.          |
|It's for all Emulators, that are          |
|Based on AscentEmu (Like ArcEmu).         |
|Changes in the batch file are also        |
|not needed, because for all 32bits        |
|Win OS's it is UNIVERSAL!                 |

First of all, welcome to my mini explenation on where
to extract the DBC Files.

Check if you have these files:
- Help.txt
- MPQE.exe
- runthis.bat
- SFmpq.dll
If not, re-download it, or seek for a download were these files are included.

Now select these 4 files, and copy/paste it to:
(Your WoW Client Directory)\Data\
for example:
C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Data\

Now the next step:
start 'runthis.bat' and select your client language in it.
It'll immediately start extracting your DBC files.
After that you can exit the tool.

You will notice a new directory named MPQOUT.
Open 'MPQOUT' and there will be a directory named DBFilesClient.
Rename 'DBFliesClient' to DBC and copy/paste 'DBC' into
your WoW Server directory.

Now you're done.

For further questions you can allways contact me on gerdpeter@hotmail.com
